A Fabric mod that displays a track map of Create trains in your world,
including all tracks, signals, stations, and trains. The signals and
trains are updated in (practically) real time.

### Usage

CTM is a _server side_ only mod. It runs a web server, on port 3876 by default, that provides the following API:

- `/api/network`, `/api/network.rt`: List of all track pieces and train stations
- `/api/signals`, `/api/signals.rt`: List of all train signals, including their states
  (green, yellow, red)
- `/api/blocks`, `/api/blocks.rt`: List of all signal control blocks, and whether they are occupied or reserved by a train
- `/api/trains`, `/api/trains.rt`: List of all assembled trains, including their names and
  positions
- `/api/style.css`: CSS style sheet generated from configured colors and fonts (Coming Soonâ„¢)

The `.rt` versions update in real time with Server-Sent Events (SSE). If using a proxy to serve the map, make sure to configure it to let Server-Sent Events through.

The map itself is visible at the root (by default
`http://localhost:3876/`). The view is not configurable at this time, but
that will come with a later version.

### Configuration

CTM's config options can be found at `create-track-map.json` in your server's config directory. It is automatically created at startup if it doesn't exist.

The following options are available:

```js
{
  // How long to wait between track data updates.
  "watch_interval_seconds": 0.5,
  // The port the internal web server listens on.
  "server_port": 3876,

  "map_style": {
    // Font to use for the map's UI. Must be a valid CSS font stack.
    "font": "ui-monospace, \"JetBrains Mono\", monospace",
    // Colors for individual components of the map. Must be valid CSS colors.
    // Any CSS color format will work, such as named colors and rgb().
    "colors": {
      "background": "#888",
      "track": {
        "occupied": "red",
        "reserved": "pink",
        "free": "white"
      },
      "signal": {
        "green": "#71db51",
        "yellow": "#ffd15c",
        "red": "#ff5f5c",
        "outline": "black"
      },
      "portal": {
        "primary": "purple",
        "outline": "white"
      },
      "station": {
        "primary": "white",
        "outline": "black"
      },
      "train": "cyan"
    }
  }
}
```

Reload the config without restarting the server by running `/ctm reload` (operator permissions required).
