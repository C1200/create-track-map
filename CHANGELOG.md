- Hopefully fixes some crashes (especially on Forge) relating to trains not being on tracks.
- Signals are now displayed with the correct colors and at the correct angles.
- Different layers (signals, stations, etc.) can now be turned on or off in the Layers menu.
- Layers can be configured to only be visible at certain zoom levels. Check the `layers` section of the example config in the README for an example of how to set this up.

Create 0.5.1 integration for Forge is now available; integration for Fabric is happening as soon as Create Fabric 0.5.1 is out.
